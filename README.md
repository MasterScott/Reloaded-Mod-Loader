# Introduction
**[Reloaded]** is an actively developed DLL Injection based Mod Loader, Mod Management System, Optional Mod SDK *(libReloaded)* among various other utilities.

It is a completely free and open source public rewrite of **Heroes Mod Loader**, my original first attempt at a mod management/loader system all the way from the ground up using the C# programming language.

**Note:** This project is deprecated. It has been superseded by [Reloaded-II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II).
